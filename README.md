## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Primary School ICT Technician** with **7+ years** of hands-on experience. Passionate about using technology to enrich education, I work across primary schools, improving IT systems and supporting educators. I hold a **BSc in Computing & IT** from the [University of Derby](https://www.derby.ac.uk/?form=MG0AV3).

I also contribute to the open-source project [FAForever](https://github.com/FAForever?form=MG0AV3), enhancing the gaming experience. 

When I'm not working, I’m a proud dad and stepdad who loves spending time outdoors, exploring new adventures, and enjoying quality time with my fiancée.
