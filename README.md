# Hi there 👋 I'm Josh (aka Rowey)

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a **Primary School ICT Technician** with over **seven years of hands-on technical experience**, passionate about using technology to enrich education and empower students and teachers. I hold a **BSc in Computing and Information Technology** from the [University of Derby](https://www.derby.ac.uk/?form=MG0AV3), where I developed a strong foundation in problem-solving, systems management, and IT innovation.

In my current role as an **ICT Cluster Technician**, I work across multiple primary schools, maintaining and improving their IT ecosystems. Whether it's troubleshooting classroom tech, streamlining systems, or introducing new tools, I take pride in making technology reliable, efficient, and easy to use.

Beyond education, I actively contribute to the open-source gaming project [FAForever](https://github.com/FAForever?form=MG0AV3), collaborating with a global community to enhance the player experience. This has sharpened my skills in development, user experience, and community engagement.

Outside of work, I’m a proud dad and stepdad to two amazing boys. I love spending time outdoors with them, from nature walks to spontaneous adventures. My fiancée and I enjoy weekend getaways and relaxing nights out at the cinema—it's all about making memories and keeping life balanced.  

Whether it’s supporting teachers in the classroom, building home tech projects, or crafting better gaming tools, I’m always exploring new ways to use technology creatively and meaningfully.
