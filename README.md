# 👋 Hey, I’m Josh — *aka* Rowey

## 👨‍💻 About Me  

💼 **Primary School ICT Technician** with **7+ years** of hands-on experience supporting schools, improving IT systems, and empowering educators.  
🎓 **BSc in Computing & IT** from the [University of Derby](https://www.derby.ac.uk/?form=MG0AV3).  
💡 Passionate about making tech an enabler for learning, not a roadblock.  

🛠 Contributor to [FAForever](https://github.com/FAForever?form=MG0AV3), an open-source gaming project where I build features and enhancements for the community.  

🌱 Outside of work, I’m a proud dad and stepdad. I'm often found outdoors exploring with my fiancée and our kids or geeking out over a new project.
